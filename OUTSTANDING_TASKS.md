## Outstanding Tasks

### 1. AisleMate Separation
**Status**: Pending  
**Description**: AisleMate currently shares Supabase tables with Cath Hub. Clarify scope:
- Should it remain shared?
- Should it be separated into Baker Hub's own shopping system?
- What tables/features does it need?

**Related Code**: `shopping.html` (standalone AisleMate page)  
**Tables**: `shopping_items`, `master_items`, `receipts`, `receipt_items` (currently shared with Cath Hub)

---

### 2. Date Deletion Persistence
**Status**: Fixed  
**Description**: Dates reappeared on refresh because the Supabase RLS policy only allowed SELECT.

**Root Cause & Fix**:
- `important_dates` table had SELECT-only RLS policy — deletes were silently rejected
- Changed to `allow_all` policy across all affected tables (`important_dates`, `house_projects`, `ndis_funds`, `ndis_transactions`, `insurance_policies`, `ndis_providers`)

---

### 3. Dashboard Error Handling
**Status**: Fixed  
**Description**: Added graceful error handling for Supabase connection failures.

**What was added**:
- Auto-retry: if data load fails, waits 2s and retries once automatically
- Retry button: if both attempts fail, shows error message with a Retry button
- Toast notifications: all error/success alerts replaced with non-blocking toast popups
- Error detail: Supabase error messages now shown to help diagnose issues

### 4. add_contact Reliability
**Status**: Fixed  
**Description**: The AI tool `add_contact` had reliability issues due to missing columns and RLS policies.

**Root Causes Found & Fixed**:
- `supabase-contacts.sql` was missing `email`, `meeting_link`, `notes`, `for_person` columns — inserts with these fields would fail
- RLS policy only allowed SELECT (no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) — changed to `allow_all` policy
- `index.html` handler lacked `if(!data)` safety check — aligned with the more robust `ai.html` version
- Improved error messages for better user feedback

---

### 5. Update Navigation Documentation
**Status**: Pending  
**Description**: CLAUDE.md navigation list (lines 24-35) is missing Monthly Tasks and Habits & Rhythms sections.

**File**: `Personal-hub/CLAUDE.md`  
**Action**: Add to sidebar navigation list:
- Monthly Tasks (Week-based organization)
- Habits & Rhythms (Frequency-based tracking)

---
